# WireGuardVPN_Client_Company_Deployment_INTUNE_APPS
This tool was develop as an Intune application to install and deploy all the configuration client (.conf) files, in a 200 employees company. This files where drop in Wireguard Client VPN application located in each company laptop.

Previously, you should have a folder containing all the .conf files of each employee in the same path as the script.

I have also include an script to modify the names of the folder to stablish the following criteria: name_surname.conf

I hope it helps anyone! <3
